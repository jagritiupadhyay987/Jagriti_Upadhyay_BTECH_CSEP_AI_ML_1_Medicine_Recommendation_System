<h1>Project Overview</h1>
<ul>A Medicine Recommendation System (MRS) is a tool that assists healthcare providers or patients in identifying the most suitable medications based on symptoms, diagnosis, patient history, and other factors. It leverages data science, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML) techniques to improve treatment accuracy. our goal is to build such a recommendation model which will help the patients for the use of right drugs high accuracy and efficiency is very critical for such a recommender system</ul>
<br>

<h1>Working of Project</h1>
<ol> Our  system recommend the medicine for first care.</ol>
<ol> A place where hospitals are not available easily..</ol>
<ol> For the travelers</ol>
<ol> Automating Prescription: Reduce time and effort in choosing the best medication.</ol>
<br>

<h1>Methodology</h1>
<p>1.	Data Collection and Preprocessing
 The initial phase involved collecting a relevant medical dataset and cleaning it using Python libraries     such as NumPy and Pandas. This preprocessing included handling missing values, normalizing data  formats, and preparing the data for analysis. <br>
2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Using Jupyter Notebook, various insights were drawn from the dataset to understand trends, correlations, and user needs. This helped in identifying the right features to be used for generating recommendations. <br>
3.	Backend Development (Python + Flask)
A Flask-based backend was developed to manage routing and handle user interactions. Specific Flask routes were created to process user inputs, generate medicine recommendations, and return results dynamically. <br>
4.	Frontend Design (HTML + Bootstrap)
A user-friendly web interface was designed using HTML and Bootstrap to ensure responsiveness and accessibility. The UI allows users to input symptoms or conditions and view recommended medicines.
